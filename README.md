<h1> NerdLauncher</h1>
<h3> A simple and cool Launcher app that lists out the apps vertically and helps you get the count of the apps activities and process created by each app.
</br> Lots of debugging options for each activity and processes created by the PackageManager in the android system. Fully contol the task and backstack of the task manager in android.
Launching activities with root priviledges without the interfere of SuperSU from the terminal.</h3>
<p> Suggestions and improvements are welcomed.  More debugging features coming soon...</p>
